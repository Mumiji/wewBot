# wewBot
This is a bot that can be public but only if given credit because there is a license.

# Editing Configurations!
```js
{
	"token": "",
	"prefix": ">>",
	"ownerID": "",
	"channelIDs": {
		"enabled": false,
		"welcomeID": ""
	},
	"publicBot": true
}
``` We have this.
Put your token in `token`, Choose your desired prefix in `prefix`, Put your User ID in `ownerID`, If you want to make it a public bot where people can add it using `[prefix]invite`, enable `publicBot`.

In the descriptions area,
```js
{
	"botName": "wewBot",
	"botDescription": "its a fucking bot. k?",
	"gameName": "",
	"mainServer": {
		"enabled": false,
		"inviteURL": ""
	}
}
```
Put your bots name in `botName`, Description of your bot in `botDescription`, `gameName` only changes the game your bot is playing, And if your bot has a server, enable `mainServer`, and put a `inviteURL` to the server in the area!

# Requirements
Do `npm install abalabahaha/eris` to use the bot!
node.js Version: `6.5.0`


# Conclusion
PLEASE do not edit A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G in `bot.js` unless you know what you are doing.
